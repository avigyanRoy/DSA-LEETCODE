QUESTION:
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:

-1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).
Return the number that I picked.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
Example 2:

Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 231 - 1
1 <= pick <= n

CODE SOLUTION:

//int guess(int num);
 

int guessNumber(int n){
	int high,low,mid,g;
    low=1;
    high=n;
    g=guess(1);
    if(g==0){
        return 1;
    }
    g=guess(n);
    if(g==0){
        return n;
    }
    while(high-low>0 && guess(mid)!=0){
        
        mid=low+(high-low)/2;   //Note this genius manipulation to avoid integer overflow
        if(guess(mid)==-1){
            high=mid;
        }
        else if(guess(mid)==1){
            low=mid;
        }
        else{
            break;
        }
    }
    return mid;
    
}
