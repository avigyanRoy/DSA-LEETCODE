QUESTION:

Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:

answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.
 

Example 1:

Input: n = 3
Output: ["1","2","Fizz"]
Example 2:

Input: n = 5
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz"]
Example 3:

Input: n = 15
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz","Fizz","7","8","Fizz","Buzz","11","Fizz","13","14","FizzBuzz"]
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 104

CODE SOLUTION:

class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> fizzBuzz(int n) {
        vector<string> ans;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if((i+1)%3==0 && (i+1)%15!=0){
                ans.push_back("Fizz");
            }
            else if((i+1)%5==0 && (i+1)%15!=0){
                ans.push_back("Buzz");
            }
            else if((i+1)%15==0){
                ans.push_back("FizzBuzz");
            }
            else{
                ans.push_back(to_string(i+1));
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
